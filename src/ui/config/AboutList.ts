        footer: "For decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition of the world from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits (ICs) – and we’ve been advancing IC technology and the ability to reliably produce ICs in high volumes for decades. Each generation of innovation builds upon the last to make technology smaller, more efficient, more reliable and more affordable – making it possible for semiconductors to go into electronics everywhere. We think of this as Engineering Progress. It’s what we do and have been doing for decades:The object-detection capability used in a $20 million military radar system from the 1980s is now possible using a $20 radar chip in automobiles everywhere to increase vehicle safety and reduce collisions.Home automation systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars 20 years ago are now only hundreds of dollars. Today, these systems are more accessible to homeowners and are making homes safer, more convenient and more energy efficient.Technology that previously was only used in expensive factory robotic systems is affordable enough to be integrated into home appliances, making common household tasks, like vacuuming, easier and more convenient.Our passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors is alive today as we help our customers develop new applications, particularly in the industrial and automotive markets.",

It provides three half-bridge gate drivers, each capable of driving highside and low-side N-channel power MOSFETs. The device generates the correct gate drive voltages using in internal charge pump and enhances the high-side MOSFETs using a bootstrap circuit. A trickle charge pump is included to support 100% duty cycle. The Gate Drive architecture supports peak gate drive currents up to 1-A source and 2-A sink. The MCF8329A can operate from a single power supply and supports a wide input supply range of 4.5 to 60 V. MCF8329A also provides a standard I2C interface for configuring the various device settings and reading fault diagnostic information through an external controller.",
